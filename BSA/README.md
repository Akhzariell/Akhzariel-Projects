# BSA (*Business & System Analysis*)

---

This folder contains assignments from the BSA (*Business & System Analysis*) training program [School 21](https://21-school.ru/we).

### The purpose of this thread:

---

1. **Product Optimization / Mastering Analytics Methods:**

> Analytics methods help identify the strengths and weaknesses of a product, allowing you to focus on improving key features and eliminating shortcomings. This helps increase efficiency, improve user experience, and achieve better business results. Data analysis helps make informed decisions, minimizing risks and avoiding ineffective decisions, which leads to successful product development and promotion.

###### 2. **Understanding Users:**

> Understanding user needs and behavior allows you to create a product that meets their expectations and brings real value. This contributes to successful promotion and strengthening of positions in the market.

###### 3. **Communication and teamwork skills:**

> Developing communication skills and the ability to work in a team allows you to effectively interact with various stakeholders (*managers, developers, marketers*) and clearly explain analytical findings. This helps speed up the decision-making process, implement changes and prevent misunderstandings in the team. These skills are important for creating a harmonious and productive work process.

###### 4. **A well-built business strategy:**

> Mastering the principles of building a business strategy helps to clearly define the company's goals and priorities based on analytical data. This helps make informed decisions on product development, functionality and marketing activities, which contributes to the company's growth, increased competitiveness and optimal use of resources to obtain maximum profit.

### Structure of this branch:

---

All these skills and knowledge are achieved through the completion of individual and group assignments using the **peer-to-peer** methodology of School 21.

This branch includes 17 assignments, of which 11 are individual and 6 are group. These projects will be stored in this directory and named with the **BSA** prefix, as well as a numeric value from 00 to 16.

Each of the folders will contain:

* Folder `src` (*files with my solution to the technical task in English*);
* Folder `src_rus` (*in Russian*);
* Files `TASK_RUS.md` and `TASK.md` (*Russian and English versions of the task*);
* Screenshot with the review results from the examiners at the school (*Peer-to-Peer methodology*).

Each project contains its own technical task (TT) and goals.

| **BSA00** | Individual | 1. Developing skills in creating and organizing workspaces and directories for effective project management.<br />2. Mastering methods for identifying and systematizing information sources for developing IT systems.<br />3. Developing the ability to compile and maintain glossaries, which helps to avoid confusion in terminology.<br />4. Mastering methods for decomposing tasks and processes, which helps to more accurately separate and analyze system components.<br />5. Developing skills in applying decomposition rules for effective structuring of information and systems.<br />6. Practice in creating and analyzing various types of decomposition to solve specific problems, such as order delivery and online registration. | The project turned out to be not too difficult, I coped with it quite quickly.<br />The only drawback of the technical specifications is the lack of introductory material on terms (*object/process/situation*),<br />which, as it seems to me, is basic for understanding the work of various types of decomposition. |
